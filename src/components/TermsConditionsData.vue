        <p class="title">How The Contract Is Formed Between You & Us</p>
        <p>
          You may place an order to purchase a Product advertised for sale on
          the Site by following the onscreen prompts after clicking on the item
          you are interested in. You will have an opportunity to check and
          correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you
          submit your order by clicking the “Proceed to Secure Payment” button
          on the “Payment Details” page.
        </p>
        <p>
          After placing an order, you will receive an e-mail (the “Order
          Confirmation”) from us acknowledging that we have received your order
          and giving an order number and a summary of your order. Please note
          that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order
          constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to
          acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by
          sending you an e-mail that confirms that the Product has been
          dispatched (the “Dispatch Confirmation”). The contract between us will
          only be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation for the
          relevant Product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have
          confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to
          supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until
          the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate
          Dispatch Confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may choose not to accept your order for any reason, and we will not
          be liable to you or to anyone else in those circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>We may be unable to process your order if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Product you ordered is out of stock or discontinued.</li>
          <li>
            There is a problem with the authorisation of your method of payment.
          </li>

      <!-- Delivery -->
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p class="title">Delivery</p>
        <p>
          We will deliver the Products to you in accordance with the delivery
          option specified by you when you placed your order (e.g. Standard
          Delivery, Express Delivery, or Special Delivery).
        </p>
        <p>
          We will dispatch all Products comprised in your order which are
          supplied by us at the same time albeit on some occasions in multiple
          packages. Delivery will be made to the delivery address specified in
          your order. Please note that a tracking number will be provided on all
          orders after being dispatched, and an email will be sent. We cannot
          deliver items within the same order to multiple addresses. We are not
          responsible for any additional carrying or positioning of Products
          ordered.

      <!-- Risk & Ownership -->
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p class="title">Risk & Ownership</p>
        <p>
          Once delivered, the Products ordered will become your responsibility
          and, except in relation to Products that are damaged or faulty when
          delivered or have been incorrectly delivered, we will not accept any
          liability for their loss, damage or destruction after they have been
          delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ownership of the Products will only pass to you on delivery of the
          Products to you; or us receiving full payment of all sums due in
          respect of the Products, (including delivery charges) whichever is the
          later.

        </p>
        <p>
          These prices include VAT, but some exclude delivery costs, which will
          be added to the total amount due once you have selected a delivery
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect
          orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch
          Confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot complete your order until you have paid for it in full.
          Payment can be made by most major credit or debit cards by completing
          the relevant details on the “Payment Details” page.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using a credit/debit card to pay for your order, you confirm that
          the card/account being used is yours. All fields indicated as
          compulsory must be completed. Please note that we will only use your
          information in accordance with our *Privacy Policy*. All credit/debit
          card account holders are subject to validation checks and
          authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses
          to authorise payment we will not accept your order, and we will not be
          liable for any delay or non-delivery, and we are not obliged to inform
          you of the reason for the refusal. We are not responsible for your
          card issuer or bank charging you as a result of our processing of your
          credit/debit card payment in accordance with your order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible
          that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our
          Site may be incorrectly priced. We will rectify any such errors as
          soon as possible once we become aware of them. If a Product’s correct
          price is different from the price stated on our Site, we will
          normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions
          before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of
          such rejection.

      <!-- Our Cancellation, Returns & Refund Policy -->
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p class="title">Our Cancellation, Returns & Refund Policy</p>
        <p>
          We can not accept returns if the product has been removed from its
          original packaging or the use of the product. The product must be in
          the condition that it came in for a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except in relation to the Products specified in the next paragraph,
          you may cancel your order (or any part of it) at any stage before the
          Products are dispatched to you, and up to 90 days afterwards. Please
          refer to your Dispatch Confirmation email for the Returns Procedure
          for online orders or by contacting our Customer Services team at
          ecommercewebsite22@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not cancel your order if the Products are (i) personalised for
          you, or (ii) perishable items (e.g. food) unless such Products were
          damaged or faulty when delivered to you or have been incorrectly
          delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you decide to cancel an order after we have dispatched the
          Products, you will be under a duty to return them to us, at your own
          risk. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage to the
          Products in transit. All such Products should be returned within 14
          days after the Products have been delivered to you. Until such time as
          they are returned, you must retain possession of the Products and take
          reasonable care of them. You should return the Products to us unused
          and in the same condition in which you received them together with the
          original Product packaging, by one of the means set out in our Returns
          Procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
          After you cancel your order and return the Products, any sum debited
          by us to your credit/debit card will be refunded in full (including
          the cost of delivery if you paid for delivery). We may make a
          deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any Products if
          the loss is a result of unnecessary handling by you. We will notify
          you of your refund via e-mail within a reasonable period of time. We
          will usually refund any money received from you using the same method
          originally used by you to pay for your purchase except PayPal returns
          in store. Refunds for Products purchased as gifts can only be given to
          the credit/debit card of the person who placed the order. We will
          process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case,
          within the earlier of (a) 14 days of the day we receive back the
          Products from you; (b) 14 days of the day you provide us with evidence
          that you have returned the Products; or (c) where no Products were
          dispatched 14 days of the day you provide your notice to cancel the
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any Product you purchase is damaged, faulty or incorrect, when
          delivered to you, we may offer an exchange or refund as appropriate,
          in accordance with your legal rights. If you believe a Product is
          faulty, you should return the Product to us in accordance with the
          Returns Procedure. If you have any questions regarding returns, please
          <router-link to="/contact">Contact us</router-link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide to return the Product by post, the refund will usually
          be processed as soon as possible and, in any case, within the earlier
          of (a) 14 days of the day we receive back the Products from you; or
          (b) 14 days of the day you provide us with evidence that you have
          returned the Products. If the Product you are returning is not faulty,
          e.g. you ordered an incorrect item, and you choose to return then we
          are not responsible for the postage or delivery charges in connection
          with the return of the Product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our policy on cancellations, returns and refunds does not affect your
          statutory legal rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 or the
          Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013. If you have further questions
          regarding your legal rights, please contact your local Citizens’
          Advice Bureau or your local Trading Standards Office.
